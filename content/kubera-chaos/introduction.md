Chaos engineering plays a vital role in increasing the resilience of todayâ€™s  cloud native, highly dynamic applications and infrastructure. 
Kubernetes developers and SREs use Kubera Chaos to increase application resilience by practicing chaos engineering through pre-defined chaos workflows and chaos monitoring tools. 
Kubera Chaos is the enterprise edition of the broadly used open source chaos engineering platform LitmusChaos.

Kubera Chaos gives you the ability to design new workflows or choose from the existing ones which cover most of the required scenarios, generate complex gitops controlled workflows.   This scales the chaos engineering efforts and increases resilience. 
The "My Hub", in Kubera Chaos Portal provides a bunch of experiments from the default hub or can create a new hub on their own by connecting their Git account which can be used by SREs and developers to collaborate to design new chaos experiments. These workflows can be easily integrated with CI & CD platforms such as GitHub actions, Gitlab CI and Spinnaker.
